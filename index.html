                        <h4>Welcome to The Green Nexus – a hub for insights and stories on ESG and sustainability. Having recently developed a passion for this field, I’m documenting my journey and sharing discoveries to explore how we can create a greener, more sustainable future together.</h4>

                        <p>Having recently graduated, I’ve been thinking a lot about my career, next steps and asking myself the question what I truly want to pursue. I came to the realisation that what I ultimately want from my career is having some sort of positive social impact. I want the role that I do on a day-to-day to contribute to enacting positive change. However, there are a plethora of ways to help. As I was researching potential career options, I came across the sustainability and ESG space. It piqued my interest as it was something I had heard about but not in the corporate world.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "When we heal the earth, we heal ourselves." - <cite>David Orr</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>‘Sustainability’, ‘carbon footprint’ and ‘net zero’ were terms I had heard a lot of and despite strongly agreeing that something had to be done to address the climate crisis, it all seemed distant, part of a larger conversation I wasn’t apart of yet. With the growing climate crises and increasing discussions around Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, I realised that this wasn’t just a trend; it was a crucial part of our future.</p>
                        <p>As I began reading and learning more, sustainability quickly became more than a casual interest. It sparked a passion in me to understand how our everyday choices—from what we buy to how companies operate—impact the world around us. I started diving deeper into ESG practices, discovering how businesses are adapting to be more environmentally and socially responsible.</p>
                        <p>This website, The Green Nexus, is my space to document this journey. Here, I’ll share insights, research, and stories about sustainability and ESG. My hope is that as I learn, you’ll join me on this path toward understanding how we can all contribute to a greener, more sustainable future!</p>

                        <h2>What is ESG and Why Should We Care?</h2>

                        <p>ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance—three key factors used to evaluate how companies operate responsibly and sustainably. It goes beyond profits to measure the broader impact of a business on the world.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "The Earth is what we all have in common." - <cite>Wendell Berry, 1977</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Breaking Down ESG:</p>
                        <p>1.	Environmental: This focuses on how a company’s operations affect the planet. Key areas include carbon emissions, energy usage, waste management, and climate change. Companies with strong environmental policies work to reduce their negative impact on the earth.</p>
                        <p>2.	Social: This covers how a company interacts with people—both employees and the wider community. It includes issues like employee treatment, diversity, health and safety, and community engagement. Companies with strong social responsibility focus on fairness, equality, and positive social impact.</p>
                        <p>3.	Governance: Governance refers to how a company is run. Are the leadership practices ethical, transparent, and accountable? Good governance includes things like fair executive compensation, diversity on the board, and strong anti-corruption policies.</p>
                        <p>ESG matters because it reflects how companies are addressing critical global challenges like climate change and resource depletion. Businesses that focus on ESG are working to minimise their environmental harm, which benefits the planet and future generations. Companies play a huge role in shaping society. When they prioritise social issues like fair labour practices, diversity, and community support, it creates a positive ripple effect that benefits everyone. Companies with strong ESG practices are often better prepared for long-term success. They’re less likely to face financial and reputational risks from environmental damage or unethical practices. Investors increasingly look at ESG as a measure of stability and trustworthiness.</p>
                        <p>ESG isn’t just about doing good—it’s about creating a sustainable and ethical future. As consumers, employees, and investors, we have the power to support companies that align with these values, helping to build a more responsible world.</p>
